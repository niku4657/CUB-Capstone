Copyright (C) 2022 Trimble

This is the ROS2 Galactic package for the Trimble Autonomous CSCI 2021-2022 Capstone team. Please refer to [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IvrRoerWze33tCi0YS-Z0yw_e3JxBHMlJ7be6PJWC5w/edit?usp=sharing) document to see ROS and OpenCV setup instructions, as well as cv_bridge setup. The requirements for this package are ROS Galactic, OpenCV 4.x, sensor_msgs, and cv_bridge. Further, this package was developed and tested using Ubuntu Focal Fossa (20.04) 64-bit.

There are additional READMEs in the /src direcetory for each node with parameter information and examples for running the nodes. There is high level documentattion for the classcial computer vision algorithm in this repository. It can be found [here](https://github.com/alexmazr/Trimble-Students/blob/main/classical_computer_vision/cpp_row_detection/README.md) or navigate to /Trimble-Students/classical_computer_vision/cpp_row_detection/README.md. Please refer to the source code in this package folder or cpp_row_detection for more detailed, method specific documentaion.
